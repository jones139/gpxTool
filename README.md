gpxTool
=======

A simple web based tool to allow creation of gpx routes and also view and analyse gpx track logs.

It will have the following functionality:
 * Allow the user to plan a route by adding route points to a map, calculate the length of the route, and allow the user to download the route as a GPX file (working)
 * Upload GPX files to the server for future retrieval
 * Download GPX files from the server and analyse them to achieve the following:
     - Display track / waypoints on a map
     - Analyse track to determine distance covered, speed etc.
     - Allow the user to select start and end point for analysis, and update the analysis & track display.
 * Share a route with other users by providing a URL that will display a particular GPX file.
